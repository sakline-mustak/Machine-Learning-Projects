# finding_donors documentation!

## Description

This project uses 1994 U.S. Census data to predict if an individual earns over $50K/year using supervised learning (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression). After comparing models, the best one is optimized to help non-profits tailor donation requests. The solution demonstrates how ML can infer income from public demographic features for real-world impact.
